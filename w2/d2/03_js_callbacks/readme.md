# Learning Objectives

- Explain the difference between blocking and non-blocking code
- Explain the concept of a 'callback' and how we can pass functions as arguments to other functions
- Describe the difference between asynchronous and synchronous program execution
- Pass a named function as a callback to another function
- Pass an anonymous function as a callback to another function

# Vocab

- Function Signature - defines input and output of functions or methods
- Parameter - the variable as found in the function definition
- Argument - the actual input passed to a function
- Callback - a function that is passed to another function as a parameter and executed inside the other function.
- Blocking Code - Delays execution of the rest of the script until it is complete
- Non-blocking - Code that doesn't halt execution of the rest of script


# Activity

Read through `callback.js`

What does the code do?

Open `index.html` and observe the output.

Identity the function signature, parameters, arguments, callbacks and any blocking code

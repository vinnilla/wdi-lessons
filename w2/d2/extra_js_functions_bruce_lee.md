#JS Function Practices.

Here are some questions.Have fun doing them!  
<strong>You won't be able to do them all at once!</strong> These are actual questions that I or my friends have personally been asked at interviews! I have collected all of these throughout the years.

After solving them, spend 2-5 minutes in reflection of the code that you wrote. Write a few comments about what is happening with the function, parameter(s), arguments, where it's being invoked, what built-in methods that you're using. This will help you understand the code better! 

Find joy while you're writing this code! Be like Bruce Lee and accept the challenge!

##Outro
This is it for now! I'll keep adding to this list when my friends/network tell me of questions that they have actually been asked.

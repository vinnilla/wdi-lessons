# Project 1 Prep!

Below are the necessary steps you must complete before you can begin
writing the code for your app. They do not happen in order, but instead
they all go on at the same time. They're broken this way arbitrarily.

Deliverable are at [the bottom](#deliverables).

## Planning

### Create a Repo

Create a new folder (in either `~/code` or `~/code/wdi`) and name it with the name of your project ("blackjack", "project-1", whatever...).

`cd` into your new folder and create a repo locally (`git init`), and on 
GitHub (`hub create`). Ensure that the repo has a file `README.md` and a folder named `assets`.

For all of planning, add any information you have to your `README.md`
and push it up. Any images should be added to `assets` and linked in to
your `README.md`.

Make sure your repo looks good and has the name of your project on it!

### Draw Wireframes

Create wireframes for your game. While you can use special applications
to build your wireframes, please start by using "pen & paper" (or
"marker & wall/desk"). Take pictures and add them to your repo's `assets`
folder. These are often called **Low-fidelity** wireframes.

Keep in mind, these discrete wireframes should be connected by "flows" 
(or arrows) describing how a user can arrive at any wireframed state/page
from any other.

### Write User Stories

Create *user stories* for your game. Add them to your `README.md`.
Make sure that your stories follow the format **ROLE**, **GOAL**,
**REASON**:

```
As a ROLE (user type), I want to GOAL, so that REASON.

Eg: As a player, I want to have the slammer activate by a click,
    so that I can control the pace of the game and feel like
    I'm actually playing it for real!
```

You may omit the reason, but only if it is **patently obvious**.

> Be comprehensive! Think wide and far about all the features (phrased
> as user stories) that you can! You should be making these **while** 
> you are working on your wireframes â€“ the processes feed in to 
> one another.

All user stories should be placed in the **Ice Box** list on your project's Trello board to start.

### Identify an MVP (i.e., Sprint Planning)

Classify the user stories that are the minimum necessary in order
to make your game work. These are your MVP (minimum-viable product).

Also: pick your first three or four fundamental user stories, and
move them to the Current list in Trello.

**Note:** do not write any user stories from the point of view of the
programmer!  Keep implementation details separate from user stories.

## Deliverables

1.  A completed repo on GitHub, with a `README.md` and images stored in
    `assets`. **Slack your project's GitHub repo link to Dan/Kedar.**
2.  A series of wireframes describing what will be visible to the user
    who uses your site. DO NOT SKIP THIS!
3.  All of the user stories, in your project's Trello board. **Be sure that your board is set to be public** so that your instructors can access it. **Slack your project's GitHub repo link to Dan/Kedar.** Your user stories will flow through the following lists:
 - `Ice Box`
 - `Current`
 - `Sprint`
 - `Done`

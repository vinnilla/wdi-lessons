## Tic-Tac-Toe with jQuery

It's your first day at a hot new start up in the tictactoe market. They want to 
reach the older Internet Explorer market and make future development smoother.

They've tasked you with porting their code to jQuery.

Using what you learned today, please attempt to **translate the vanilla JS into jQuery**!

If everything goes well, you should see the length of your code drop dramatically.

Don't forget to include a jQuery CDN. https://code.jquery.com/

Good Luck!

# The Apartment Complex

[![Shirley you're joking.](assets/shirley_maclaine.gif)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apartment)

### Instructions

For the following assignment you'll be given descriptions of objects
and some example code that clarifies how that object works. It's up to
you to write the requisite classes, instantiate and test the given 
objects according to the examples!

### Setup

1.  Do the work in your student folder for today, in a folder named
    **`the_apartment`**.
1.  Put work in the appropriately named file:
    - When prompted to define a class, write the class definition inside
      of a file with the same name as the class. (**Example:** A `Unicorn` 
      class would be in a file named `unicorn.rb`)
1.  Save your changes using `git` often! At the very least, use 
    `git add .` and `git commit -m "..."` after you finish each part. 
    This means that whenever you submit your homework, you will send us 
    your most updated work!
1.  **[Timebox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)** the problems: 
    limit how much time you will devote to a problem before you move on!

### Completion

**Finish at least the first 4 parts of The Apartment.**

## Part 1

**filename `tenant.rb`**

Create a **tenant** class to store tenant data and behavior. A tenant should have the following attributes:

> Set at initialize:

- f_name
- l_name
- born_on
- gender

> Set after instantiation with setter and getter methods:

- nickname
- occupation

Example Usage:

```rb
p1 = Tenant.new("Calvin", "Clifford", "male", "December 21st, 1929")
p1.nickname = "Bud"
p1.occupation = "Office Drone"
```

## Part 2

A **tenant** should have a `full_name` method that returns a string of 
their first name, last name and nickname (if they have one).

Example Usage:

```rb
p1 = Tenant.new("Calvin", "Clifford", "male", "December 21, 1929")
p1.nickname = "Bud"
p1.full_name #=> "Calvin 'Bud' Clifford"
```

## Part 3

**filename `apartment.rb`**

An **apartment** should have the following attributes:

> Set at initialize:

- unit
- num_beds
- num_baths
- tenants (the collection of people renting the apartment)

Example Usage:

```rb
a1 = Apartment.new("B", 2, 1)
a1.tenants #=> []
a1.tenants.length #=> 0
```
## Part 4

An **apartment's** price should be dynamically calculated based on the 
number of beds ($1000 per bed) and the number of bathrooms ($500 per 
bathroom).

Example Usage:

```rb
a2 = Apartment.new("A", 2, 1)
a2.price #=> "$2500"
```

## Part 5

An **apartment** should have a predicate method to determine if it's a 
studio (has only one bedroom).

Example Usage:

```rb
a1 = Apartment.new("B", 2, 1)
a2 = Apartment.new("A", 1, 1)
a1.studio? #=> false
a2.studio? #=> true
```

## Part 6

An **apartment** should have *several* methods related to its tenants.

`move_in` should take a tenant object as input and add it to the list of
tenants.

Example Usage:

```rb
a1 = Apartment.new("B", 1, 1)
p1 = Tenant.new("Fran", "Kubelik", "female", "May 8, 1935")
a1.move_in(p1)
a1.tenants          #=> [#<Tenant:0x01â€¦>]
                    #   The above means an array
                    #   of Tenant instances!
a1.tenants.class    #=> Array
a1.tenants[0].class #=> Tenant
a1.tenants.length   #=> 1
```

## Part 7

`empty?` should return `true` if an apartment doesn't have any tenants 
and `false` if it has tenants.

Example Usage:

```rb
a1 = Apartment.new("B", 1, 1)
a1.empty? #=> true
p1 = Tenant.new("Fran", "Kubelik", "female", "May 8, 1935")
a1.move_in(p1)
a1.empty? #=> false
```

`full?` should return true if the number of tenants in an apartment is 
equal to the number of bedrooms.

Example Usage:

```rb
a2 = Apartment.new("B", 2, 1)
p1 = Tenant.new("Al", "Kirkeby", "male", "January 23, 1949")
p2 = Tenant.new("Karl", "Matuschka", "male", "June 27, 1949")
a2.empty? #=> true
a2.full?  #=> false
a2.move_in(p1)
a2.empty? #=> false
a2.full?  #=> false
a2.move_in(p2)
a2.full?  #=> true
```

## Part 8

If you try to add more tenants than an apartment's bedrooms you'll 
receive a message `"We're full! <TENANT NAME> can't move in!"`

Example Usage:

```rb
p1 = Tenant.new("Mildred", "Dreyfuss", "female", "July 18, 1942")
p2 = Tenant.new("Jeff", "Sheldrake", "male", "November 18, 1941")
p3 = Tenant.new("Joe", "Dobisch", "male", "May 17, 1939")
a3 = Apartment.new("F", 2, 1)
a3.move_in(p1)
a3.move_in(p2)
a3.full?        #=> true
a3.move_in(p3)  #=> "We're full! Joe Dobisch can't move in"
a3.tenants.size #=> 2
```

## Part 9

**filename `building.rb`**

A **building** should have the following attributes:

> At initialize:

- address
- number of floors

> With getters and setters:

- apartments

Example Usage:

```rb
b1 = Building.new("208 Leonard St", 3)
b1.apartments #=> {}
```

Define an instance method called `add` that takes the floor number and 
an apartment object as inputs and adds that apartment to the specified 
floor.

Example Usage:

```rb
a1 = Apartment.new("B", 2, 1)
a2 = Apartment.new("A", 1, 1)
a3 = Apartment.new("A", 1, 1)

# Specifiy the floor and apartment object
b1.add(1, a1)
b1.add(1, a2)
b1.add(2, a3)
```

Define an instance method called `floor` that takes a floor number as 
an input and returns an array of the apartments on that floor.

Example Usage:

```
b1.floor(1) #=> [<#Apartment:01>, <#Apartment:02>]
b1.floor(2) #=> [<#Apartment:03>]
```

Define an instance method called `collect_rents` that returns the 
combined prices of its apartments.

Example Usage:

```rb
b1.collect_rents
#=> 5500
```

Define a predicate method called `vacancies?`
that returns true if any of the apartments aren't full.

```rb
b1 = Building.new("208 Leonard St", 3)
a1 = Apartment.new("B", 2, 1)
b1.add(1, a1)
p1 = Tenant.new("Al", "Kirkeby", "male", "January 23, 1949")
a1.move_in(p1)
puts b1.vacancies?
#=> true
```

## Bonus

Require Ruby's 'date' library and save a tenant's `born_on` attribute 
as a `Date`.

Example Usage:

```rb
p1 = Tenant.new("Mildred", "Dreyfuss", "female", "July 18, 1942")
p1.born_on.class #=> Date < Object
```

Implement an `age` method that returns their age in years.

Example Usage:

```rb
p2 = Tenant.new("Jeff", "Sheldrake", "male", "November 18, 1941")
p2.age
#=> 73
```

## Bonuser

Write a command line interface that manages your buildings, apartments, 
and tenants.

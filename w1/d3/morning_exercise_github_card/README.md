# GitHub Card

You all have shown promise, and have learned much about programming. You've
even begun to build up a profile of work on GitHub. That means that it is now
time to get your official GitHub Card!

Except... there is no card. No worries: **we'll just make one!**

Here is an example:

<img alt="Example, completed card for H4W5." src="https://i.imgur.com/bEgDIPg.png" width="500px">

Use the beginning code provided in the student folder:
[`index.html`](index.html) & [`main.css`](css/main.css).

The card must have, at least:

1. Your GitHub profile's image.
2. Your GitHub user name.
3. Your full name.
4. A hypertext link.

It can also have titles, dates, your home city, or your personal website.
Anything on your GitHub profile!

### Step 1

Copy the necessary files out of the instructor folder and in to the day's
folder. **Do not work in the instructor folder!**

### Step 2

Write the necessary HTML (or data) for the card.

### Step 3

Write CSS to style it!

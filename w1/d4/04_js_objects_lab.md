## Building and Referencing Objects

In today's lab, we'll take what we've learned about JS objects and put it to work! We'll be practicing modeling real world (or videogame!) objects in one or more of these exercises.

We'll have options for you to practice, so you can do any or all of the sections of the lab.

Do your work either in a JSBin, a new Snippet, or in your Chrome console. 

#### <u>Model Yourself from Your Parents</u>

Similar to how we made Obediah Jecht into an object, you'll **create yourself as an object**. However, unlike Obediah, you'll build your parents first, and then **build yourself by referencing their attributes**!

1. First build two objects `mom` and `dad` as object literals (e.g. `var mom = {};`). If you have a non-traditional family structure, just use someone everybody loves, like Joe Biden.
2. Create a personality object and a physical object for each parent (e.g. `mom.personality = {};`);
3. Using the different data types (Number, String, Array, Object, Null, & Boolean) add **5 personality attributes** your parents.
4. Do the same with the physical objects!
5. Now build yourself by referencing physical and personality attributes from your folks!
6. Make 2 lists: first, what you're good at, and second, what you're bad at.
7. Age yourself.
8. Delete half of the things you were good at.
9. Age yourself.
10. Add `'sitting'` to the things you're good at and remove everything else from the list.
11. Add 5 more things to the list of things you're bad at.
12. Reassign yourself to the string: "Nothing but dust in the wind".

#### <u>Become [Ash Ketchum](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ash_Ketchum)</u>

You are now a pokemon trainer. Yes, your middle school dreams (lower school maybe? ok, high school.) are now fulfilled. **Build your starting six pokemon!**

1. Create each pokemon as an object literal.
2. Give each pokemon at least five properties - be sure to use each data type in the properties (think `health: 500` or `moves: ['ice punch', 'friend chip', 'mega sneeze']`).
3. Give each pokemon a reference to another pokemon, in case they faint!
4. Create an array `myPokemon` and push or unshift each pokemon into the array into the order you choose.

**BONUS**: Give your pokemon a move as a method - make it remove an amount of HP from another pokemon foe!!

#### <u>Build a Pizza Menu</u>

Become the sweaty human behind the counter, make your menu, and start making some friggin' pizzas.

1. Create a menu object.
2. Create 5 pizzas, each referenced within the menu object as distinct properties.
3. Be sure to use each data type in the properties (think `calories: 5000`, `meat: null` or `preferredBy: 'vegetarians'`).
4. Give each pizza 6 properties.

**BONUS**: Create a method on the menu object that prints to the console the entirety of the menu!

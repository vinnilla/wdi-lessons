# All Bugged Up

## Debugging in JavaScript

Last night, you may have worked on nodeschool.io's javascripting tutorial.

I figured I could use the practice and did the same thing! However, I never checked my code while writing, and when I ran it, oh boy did I have some errors.

In today's exercise, you're going to fix my code!

#### Assets

Please copy the `starter_code/` outside of `instructor/`. You'll be fixing my `all_bugged_up.js` file. 

After opening up the `index.html` in the browser, you can ignore the html page and work solely in the console. 

#### Chrome Dev Tools

If you can't figure out why something is messing up, often a great tool is the chrome debugger.

1. __Blue__ - You'll find the very useful debugging tool in the sources tab.
2. __Red__ - You can set break points to stop the code and play around at that moment in run time!
3. __Green__ - Once you'd like to move on, you can click the play-looking button to "resume script execution".

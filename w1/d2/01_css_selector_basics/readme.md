# What is CSS?

CSS is a web technology used to format HTML documents. With the advent of CSS3, CSS can also provide some stylistic behaviors using CSS animations.

CSS enables us to separate the structure & content (HTML) of a document from its presentation. This concept of separation of concerns is widespread throughout software development because it helps make programs more maintainable and provides better code reuse.

Like most skills related to development, your CSS chops will continually develop over time with each front-end project you're involved with.

# Basic CSS Syntax

The following graphic shows the basic syntax of a CSS rule:

- **Selectors**:
  - Used to target the element(s) to be styled.
  - Can range from simple to complex.
  - Multiple selectors can be separated with commas.
- **Properties**:
  - There are over two hundred CSS properties that can be used to style the color, size, text, position, border, animation, etc. of elements.
- **Value**:
  - The value to apply to a property is, of course, specific to that property. For example, the CSS property, _font-family_, accepts values of names of fonts such as _Georgia_, _Arial_, etc. Other properties may have numeric values along with a type of unit assigned to them, for example, you might set the width of a border to _5px_.
- **Declaration**:
  - The combination of a _property_ and _value_, separated by a colon and ending with a semi-color, makes a _declaration_.

# 	12 - this will be the main file that we actually execute.
# 		 a) Here, we should use "require_relative" to load the three files we made today.
# 		 b) If you want, you can write some executable code here
# 	
# 	e.g. shelter1 = Shelter.new("The Glue Factory")
# 		 doggy = Animal.new("Donald", "Terrier", 10, "male")
# 		 shelter1.add_animal(doggy)
# 				 
# 		 puts shelter1.animals
